- 👋 Hi, I’m @Volfy!
- 🌱 I’m a Fullstack Developer! My current fave stack is T3 with Clerk, but at work I mostly use NodeJS with Koa and AngularJS.
- 🎼 I'm a music producer - i love to learn new techniques & software.
- 💭 When not working on projects, I usually read / watch videos about Philosophy, Anthropology, BioTech, Cooking & Fermentation (but my interests shift quite often!)
- 🕹️ Don't be fooled, I'm also a gamer sometimes. Currently i'm playing Elden Ring
